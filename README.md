# Stalkimus Maximus
My 1 day marathon of a WhatsApp stalker, and me learning to scrape with Selenium!

## What is Stalkimus Maxmius?
Stalkimus Maximus is a WhatsApp "activity monitor" (stalker) for contacts.
It is a short script using Selenium and the WhatsApp Web interface

## Setup
* Download Selenium using pip or using: ``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt ```
* Download the chrome driver path from [Here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) (Unfortunately I support only chrome to date)
* Configure the config.json accordingly:
    * Make sure the chromedriver_path points to the .exe installed
    * Set up the contact_name to the name of the contact you wish to monitor
    * Disable/Enable logging as required and set-up the requested log file

You're ready to go!

## Usage
Simply run the script, log into WhatsApp Web, hit enter in the terminal and Stalkimus Maximus will run!
Make sure you keep the Stalkimus Maximus window on the chat of the person you are stalking.
To exit, hit Ctrl+C in the Stalkimus Maximus terminal.

## Warning
You will appear online!
